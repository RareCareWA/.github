## Hi there 👋

Hello welcome to the RareCare org!

You can find tools to help you in the forked repos as well as project boards for each of the internship projects. except the Cliniface project which you can find at https://github.com/frontiersi/Cliniface working with @richeytastic

Not all tools are able to be forked into GitHub so the other resources below may also be helpful...

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
